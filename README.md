Once saw a game where you made potions with some ingredients and once played a minecraft mod where you could like smelt down items into magic essence and recombine them into other things and was inspired to make a game with similair mechanics, but specifically where the ingredients/essences could interact with eachother and with the environment (eg, pressure, temperature), hopefully leading to complex interactions and potential for recipes
